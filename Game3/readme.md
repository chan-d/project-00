Hearts are generated randomly all over the map. But only one heart will come out at a time. After a heart is collected, they will show up at the top of the page. After one charater collets 5 hearts, they win and the game will reset.


Planned Features

I plan to chage some of the styling. The characters are a little hard to see and the hearts are sometimes hard to find. Maybe turn the opacity down for the background image. And stylize the scoreboard more to look better. Also, the HTML file is very lengthy with a lot of repeat code that I hope to refine it down. Also, figure out a way to code the scoreboard.
